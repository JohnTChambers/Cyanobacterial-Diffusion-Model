# Diffusion Model of Cyanobacterial Nutrient Consumption and Phototaxis

This notebook represents a model of Cyanobacterial nutrient consumption that was created for Dr. Orit Peleg's 'Advanced Dynamic Models in Biology' course at the University of Colorado Boulder in February 2021. The model and accompanying presentation recieved an A+ from Dr. Peleg.

## Description

This model visualizes the nutrient consumption of a group of randomly or specifically placed Cyanobacterial colonies around a number of nutrient sources. The number and strength of each nutrient sources may be varied, along with the number and strength of each colony. Additionally, each colony will naturally migrate towards the area of highest nurtient density, simulating real photo- or chemo-taxis. This model was originally written in R, then translated to Python by the author.
